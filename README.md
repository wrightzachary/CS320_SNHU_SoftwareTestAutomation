- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - To ensure my software is secure I take the necessary steps to allow my program to meet the project requirments and that I am getting done what exactly the client and user story says. Software security should be the number one priority when writitng any code to ensure you are following the best practices. 
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - I read requirements and user stories many times and write down notes of eveyrthing that is being asked in the story. At the end of this if I am still unsure, I ask questions until I feel confident I have every piece of data needed to write the code to fulfill the user story. 
- How do I approach designing software?
  - Designing software normally comes from the user story, as so many think but it is far more to that. When writing code you have to first identify the problem, find the best approach, and make sure the approach is following the big o notation to allow the costs to minimum.
